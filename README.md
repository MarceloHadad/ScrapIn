# ScrapIn

The ScrapIn its just an almost "scraping" that I've made with the idea of automating something that I've did several times, like copying recruiters profiles to add later, companies profiles to search for jobs and save details from jobs to use as a orientator about what technologies should I know based on positions that I want to apply.

This is the first README version and I'll add more things later.

## Requirements

To run these scripts you will just need a browser to run them on the dev tools console, but I'll seek to make the process more autonomous.

## Configuration

To use these scripts you will only need to run the models.js first, and then you can use only the main.js to get the information.
To get these informations to save somewhere else you can "Copy Object" from the output. I'm currently manually saving those info on an txt.
